# Scrolling Distance Visualization

- This project aims to visualized the scrolled distance by the user, by translating the distance into everyday units.
    - The scrolled distance is to be translated into units of the metric system; _mm_, _cm_, _m_ and _km_.
    - These units are to be calculated by mapping the resolution of a screen to the scrolled distance.
- The visualizations is to be enhanced by so-called _Milestones_ on the way; e.g. _10k_, _Half Marathon_, _Marathon_, etc.
- The project should end in making a `npm`-Package available.
